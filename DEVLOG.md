## 2026-04-16 — Dead code removal (#3)

**What happened:**
- Deleted 8 no-op stub functions from `state.js` (`loadHighScore`, `saveMeta`, `loadSettings`, etc.)
- Removed 3 game-only G fields from declaration and `resetRun()`: `attunement`, `perkPaused`, `iframeUntil`
- Removed `grazesLifetime` and `meta.unlocked` / `meta.achievements` (game-only, never read by audio)
- Deleted entire `CFG.PERKS` block from `config.js` (~23 lines)
- Removed all 4 `PerkAudioEngine` dead branches from `03d_state_mapper.js` and its `initRun` call from `state.js`
- Updated stale comments in `03g_narrative.js` referencing the removed engine

**Note:** `G.perks` kept — `StateMapper` still reads it for overdrive perk detection (future-compatible array, always `[]` standalone).

**Files changed:** `src/state.js`, `src/config.js`, `src/03d_state_mapper.js`, `src/03g_narrative.js`, `INDEX.md`

## 2026-04-16 — Foundation: AudioContext lifecycle + gate script (#1 + #2)

**What happened:**
- Fixed AudioContext lifecycle: Stop now suspends the context (not abandons it); Start resumes it and waits for `running` state before the beat clock begins. Single context reused across all play/stop cycles — no leaks, no silent failures from browser context limits.
- Fixed autoplay policy: `initAudio()` now calls `resume()` if the context already exists but is suspended. `Conductor.start()` chains `startBeatClock` off the resume promise so scheduled times are valid from beat 1.
- Rewrote `npm run gate`: replaced the broken `node --check dist/index.html || true` with (1) `vm.Script` syntax check on the raw concatenated JS before HTML injection, (2) smoke test that verifies CFG, G, Conductor, HarmonyEngine, Sequencer are defined after top-level eval. Failures now exit loudly.

**Files changed:** `src/03_audio.js`, `src/conductor.js`, `build.js`, `package.json`

**What's next:** #3 dead code purge (stubs, vestigial G fields, CFG.PERKS)

## 2026-04-16 — Extraction & Pipeline Setup

**What happened:**
- Extracted all 11 audio modules from DemoShooter verbatim (03_audio.js through 03g_narrative.js)
- Created config.js (audio-only constants from 01_config.js) and state.js (virtual game state replacing 02_state.js)
- Built Conductor module — virtual game loop that drives phase progression, combo ramp, and musical events autonomously
- Created standalone HTML UI with: FFT ring visualizer, palette picker, phase override pills, combo/volume sliders, transport controls
- Set up build system (build.js concatenates src/ → dist/index.html), dev server (localhost:3001), package.json
- Populated portable project pipeline (CLAUDE.md, INDEX.md, DEVLOG.md, spec template) adapted for HarmonyEngine-only development

**What's next:**
- Smoke test: build + run, verify all 10 palettes play through all 5 phases
- Fix any runtime errors from game-state references that weren't stubbed (StateMapper's PerkEffects* references most likely)
- First real feature: palette-lock mode, BPM override

**Decisions:**
- Copied audio modules verbatim — no refactoring during extraction. Changes come through the pipeline.
- Virtual Conductor replaces game loop: simulates combo ramp + DC progression so music evolves naturally.
- Separate repo planned (Rennding/HarmonyEngine) but not created yet.
